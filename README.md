# cosmosOdyssey

This is the MVP of Web Application "Cosmos Odyssey"<br/>
<br/>
Flow: Select source planet and destination planet, view possible flights, filter them if needed and/or sort them and choose for reservation.<br/>
<br/>
Reservations can be viewed from the Reservations tab above, the same with past API-s.<br/>
<br/>
The application could be further improved by including multi-stop routes, for which an algorithm would be needed that would make page load much faster than it is (because right now for example to get all indirect paths from Earth to Venus, the page load time for me was 1 minute).<br/>
